# Sliding-Puzzle-Game-using-AI
Developed an interactive 3x3 sliding puzzle game using Python and Pygame, featuring real-time player controls alongside an AI opponent. Implemented an A* search algorithm to solve the puzzle efficiently. The game tracks and compares player and AI performance (time and moves) and presents results via a popup.
